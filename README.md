## Background:
- Booking.com headquarters are located in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
- Agoda headquarters are located in Singapore
- Currently Agoda is a currently a subsidiary of Booking Holdings.
## Objective of the study
- Compare the hotel booking platforms [Booking](https://www.booking.com/) and [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/)
 
## Limitations of the study
- The impossibility to access to the Booking.com official data (API or Database) have forced to use web scrapping, this method might under-represent the number of hotels and locations for this platform
- This is a quantitative (number of hotels) not qualitative (prices) due to the lack of easy access to Booking.com data.
- The number of hotels are not filtered by type of accomodation and include hotels, apartments, villas and other types, again accessing booking source data is needed to filter the type of accomodation
